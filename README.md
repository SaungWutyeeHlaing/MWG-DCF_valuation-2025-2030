## Model Assumptions
Unit: All financial values are in million VND.
Projection Period: 2024 to 2030
WACC: 9%
Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%
## Output
Intrinsic equity value per share : VND 155,886

### According to the results, the upside is over +120% which seems quite an optimistic assumption. However, if the assumptions are all correct and no error is in the model, i would suggest the investor to BUY. Another thing to note is starting from 2025, the gross margin %YOY remained flat at 22% which is skeptical for a company like MWG that is recovering from the restructuring process.
